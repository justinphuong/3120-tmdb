Justin Phuong CIS 3120 TMDb API Analysis Final Project

This analysis of the TMDb API explores trends in genre popularity, release patterns, audience ratings, and the relationship between popularity and ratings. These findings paint a picture of how studios strategize releases, how audiences respond, and what factors drive success in the entertainment industry.

In order to run the code, make a folder that has the "tmdb project.py" file, and a new python file named "key.py" and paste your API key as "API_KEY = '____'". (For Prof. Nagale, I included my API key as a comment on Brightspace, just make a key.py on your end and paste my comment).
